# 🚀 DevOps Study App: Cloud-Native CI/CD & Kubernetes Platform

## For Hiring Managers

**What this demonstrates:** Production-grade CI/CD pipeline design — from code commit to deployed application, with automated quality gates at every stage.

**What to evaluate:**
- `.github/workflows/` — GitHub Actions pipeline definitions
- `kubernetes/` — Kustomize overlays for environment-specific deployment
- `.devcontainer/` — Standardized developer environment
- `src/` — Application code (Python 3.13)
- `release-please-config.json` — Automated semantic versioning

**Skills demonstrated:** GitHub Actions, Trivy, PyTest, Ruff, Release Please, DevContainers, K3d, Kustomize, Docker, Python, zero-downtime deployment patterns

**Time invested:** 47+ commits

A fully automated CI/CD pipeline and Kubernetes deployment platform designed to simulate **real-world production infrastructure**. This project demonstrates **end-to-end DevOps best practices**, including GitOps workflows, automated testing, container security, infrastructure automation, and AI-ready deployment patterns.

> **Purpose:** Build a production-grade platform that enables developers to ship applications faster, safer, and with zero manual intervention.
